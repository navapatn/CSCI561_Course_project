Project 1
Path-Finding Algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) in a 3D maze

For this assignment we applied AI search techniques to solve sophisticated 3D mazes. Each 3D maze is a grid of points with (x,y,z) locations, there are 18 actions our agent can make (see assignment pdf for more details). The program should output the optimal path (according to the search algorithm).

Project 2
Little-GO agent on a 5x5 GO board

This assignment was open-ended and allowed us to use any search, game playing, or reinforcement learning technique we desired. I decided to implement Alpha-Beta Pruning search.

Note: I wanted to try using Q-learning and estimating the function using Neural Network, but with time constraint I did not end up trying it

Project 3
MLP From scratch
MNIST dataset

implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and use it to classify hand-written digits shown from scrach (machine learning libraries are NOT allowed (including
tensorflow (v1&v2), caffe, pytorch, torch, cxxnet, and mxnet)
